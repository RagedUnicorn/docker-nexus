# docker-nexus

> A docker base to build a container for Sonatype Nexus3 based on Alpine Linux

### Using the image

#### Start container

The container can be easily started with `docker-compose` command.

```
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Stop container

To stop all services from the docker-compose file

```
docker-compose down
```

## Dockery

In the dockery folder are some scripts that help out avoiding retyping long docker commands but are mostly intended for playing around with the container. For production docker-compose should be used.

#### Build image

The build script builds an image with a defined name

```
sh dockery/dbuild.sh
```

#### Run container

Runs the built container. If the container was already run once it will `docker start` the already present container instead of using `docker run`

```
sh dockery/drun.sh
```

#### Attach container

Attaching to the container after it is running

```
sh dockery/dattach.sh
```

#### Stop container

Stopping the running container

```
sh dockery/dstop.sh
```

## Configuration

Most of the configuration can be changed in the `nexus.properties` configuration file. The configuration is copied into the container on buildtime. After a change to the file the container must be rebuilt.

## Persistence

The container is storing data in a docker volume `/nexus-data`.

## Healthcheck

The production image supports a simple healthcheck whether the container port is reachable. This can be configured inside `docker-compose.yml`

## Development

To debug the container and get more insight into the container use the `docker-compose.dev.yml`

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

By default the launchscript `/docker-entrypoint.sh` will not be used to start the Nexus process. Instead the container will be setup to keep `stdin_open` open and allocating a pseudo `tty`. This allows for connecting to a shell and work on the container. A shell can be opened inside the container with `docker attach [container-id]`. Nexus itself can be started with `./docker-entrypoint.sh`.
